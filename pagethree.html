<h1>To the Bowl!</h1>
<br>
<p>The ingredients are taken out in their correct measurements and mixed into a large bowl. Banana and another one of its siblings get mashed ina seperate the bowl and eventually, join the rest of the gang. They happily sing together as they start to become one. They get poured into a baking tray. Then, they get put into the <a href="file:///Users/Alice/Desktop/Web%20Fundamentals/pagefour.html">oven.</a>
