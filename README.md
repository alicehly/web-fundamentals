  When a user enters a web address or URL into the address bar of a browser it takes them to a webpage. The user interface may consist of photos, text, videos, and whatever components the website provides. This happens through a system of communication between the web, the Internet, Http, and HTML. The Internet functions as a network of computers linked through telephone lines. The Web is a collection of web pages, photos, videos, text files, and music files that functions within the Internet. 
  
  The exchanging of information happens through HyperText Transfer Protocol, also known as HTTP. The information is exchanged from one computer (the client), which runs the web browser, and tells the recieving computer what information is needed. HTML, also known as Hypertext Markup Languge, is the universal language in all computer files that structure text and is one of the components that codes things to display the interface of a page.
